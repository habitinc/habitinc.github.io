# React Base Level Commands
## Creating a Root Element and Rendering to Index.js
### The Assumption is made that index.html contains a div with ID of 'app'
```React


import React from "react";

import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./App";

  

createRoot(document.getElementById("app")).render(<App />);
```
Top Level Imports
```React

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

```

# Creating Next.JS App

`npx create-next-app@latest ./` --> once running GitBash in directory/folder you want


File Structure:
## App (main directory)

>>>--->layout.jsx (is layout that wraps all pages, pass {children} as props (children of other pages))
>>>--->page.jsx (should be the homepage for app)

--> API (sub-directory in app)
>>> api routes/handlers

->sub-directory of any name (sub-directory in app)
>>> page.jsx
>>

-> components (sub-directory in app)
>>> Nav.jsx
>>> Header.jsx
>>> Footer.jsx
>>> AnyOtherComponent.jsx

-> models (sub-directory in app)

-> public (sub-directory in app)

 --> assets (sub-directory in app)
 
->styles (sub-directory in app)
>>>globals.css

-> utils (sub-directory in app)
>>> Would house database.js if you were using a serverless DB (MongoDB)

>>>.env (environment variables file) (in app folder)


# Deploying Next.js with Vercel

## Ensure .env file is added to gitignore `.env` underneath the #dependencies section

### YouTube tutorial of Next.js deployment on Vercel: [Link Text](https://youtu.be/wm5gMKuwSYk?list=PL6QREj8te1P7gixBDSU8JLvQndTEEX3c3&t=11537)

--> Ensure project and file structure is correct, then ensure project is pushed to PUBLIC git repository

--> Add New (Project)

--> Ensure GitHub allows access to all repos to Vercel

--> Click Import

--> Root directory/Build and output settings remain the same

--> Add .env variables to Environment Variables within settings of project deployment


# React and Next.JS General Notes

Using Routing in Next.JS (can nest folders, simply uses folders as routes)
> --> APP (overall directory)
> > --> any sub folder within app directory is a route

Using Dynamic Routing
> Create folder with square brackets [folder] and then files inside can be dynamically rendered for slugs
