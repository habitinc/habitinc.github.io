Custom themes are developed using [Understrap](https://docs.understrap.com/#/). This is still a work-in-progress to replace the old `sample-base-theme` repo.

# To Create a Brand New Theme

1. Download the Understrap Parent Theme and Child Theme.
2. Create a new repo with the following structure
   ```custom-theme-name/
   ├── plugins/
   |
   ├── themes/
   │ ├── understrap
   │ └── understrap child
   ```
3. Rename the Understrap Child Theme to the new project
4. Using the [LocalWP Guide](/posts/wordPressThemesSetup/) set up the environment locally
